%% Lab 3: PCA-based Face Recognition
% We will use the ORL database, available to download on AT&Tâ€™s web site. This 
% database contains photographs showing the faces of 40 people. Each one of them 
% was photographed 10 times. These photos are stored as grayscale images with 
% $112\times92$ pixels. 
% 
% In our example, we construct a catalog called |orlfaces|, comprised of 
% people named $s_1, s_2, . . . , s_{40}$, each one of them containing 10 photographs 
% of the person. The data has already been split into a training and testing split, 
% where for each person, we use the first 9 photographs for training and the last 
% photograph for test.
% 
% 1. Load the training data

%  2. Change each $(d_1, d_2) = (112, 92)$ photograph into a vector

% 3. Using all the training photographs for the $N$ people in the training 
% dataset, construct a subspace $H$with dimensionality less than or equal to $N$such 
% that this subspace has the maximum dispersion for the $N$ projections. To extract 
% this subspace, use Principal Component Analysis, as described below - 
% 
% * Center the data
% * Compute the correlation matrix
% * Use either the |SVD| or |eig| functions to perform SVD and get the eigenvectors 
% and eigenvalues for the correlation matrix.
% * Normalize the eigenvectors by the corresponding eigenvalues.

% 5. Plot the first 3 eigenfaces and the last eigenface (these will be the 
% correctly reshaped eigenvectors)

%% 
% 6. Pick a face and reconstruct it using $k = {10, 20, 30, 40}$ eigenvectors. 
% Plot all of these reconstructions and compare them. For each value of $k$, plot 
% the original image, reconstructed image, and the difference b/w the original 
% image and reconstruction in each case. Write your observations.

% 7. Load the testing data, and reshape it similar to the training data.

% 8. For each photograph in the testing dataset, you will implement a classifier 
% to predict the identity of the person. To do this, follow these steps - 
% 
% * Determine the projection of each test photo onto $H$ with different dimensionalities 
% $d = {10, 20, 30, 40}$
% * Compare the distance of this projection to the projections of all images 
% in the training data.
% * For each test photo's projection, find the closest category of projection 
% in the training data.
